# VolcanoMap
This is the first project I am putting on GitHub!
It is currently a work in progress and I intend on changing the colors of the circles to look more appealing.
I also plan on implementing a feature that allows the user to click a circle which will display the name of the volcano and other relevant information.

The size of the circles are based of each volcano's PEI (Population Exposure Index)

The colors range from yellow (PEI==1) to red (PEI==8)
