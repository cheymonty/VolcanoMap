# VolcanoMap
This is the first project I am putting on GitHub!
It is currently a work in progress and I intend on changing the colors of the circles to look more appealing.
I also plan on implementing a feature that allows the user to click on a PEI button to only display volcanos that have the specified PEI

The size of the circles are based of each volcano's PEI (Population Exposure Index)

The colors range from yellow (PEI==1) to red (PEI==8)


Implements:
  Javascript |
  p5.js |
  Mappa (p5.js library) |
  HTML/CSS
